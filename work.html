    <h1> WELCOME TO EXPLORE MY WORKS!</h1>
    <p> Hey there! I'm more intrested about projects, and one trend<br>
        that's really exciting to me is the move towards individualized<br> 
        learning paths.I have done a few projects and research paper.<br> 
        Since it was mostly in school,I did everything resource based. <br>
        The street light project which I did was a success and trying to<br>
        add in Anokha 24..!
